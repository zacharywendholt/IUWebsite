		<p>I grew up in Ferdinand Indiana. I spent a lot of my childhood playing in the woods behind my house. I loved problem solving, and building things with my hands. This made me believe that my future was in mechanical engineering. In my last year of high school I decided to take a class in computer science and found that that was a better fit for me. Now I am a junior at IU going for a major in computer science with a specialization in AI.
